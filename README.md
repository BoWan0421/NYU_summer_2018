# Class administrivia


The lectures are up on youtube and linked in the github here: https://github.com/EricSchles/NYU_summer_2018/tree/master/lectures

Please note - there are also notes from the lectures found here: https://github.com/EricSchles/NYU_summer_2018/tree/master/lectures

The homework assignments can be found here: https://github.com/EricSchles/NYU_summer_2018/blob/master/assignments.md

There will also be 4 projects for the course, they will be:

Implementing an ALU
Implementing Linear Regression
Making a simplified Twitter
Implementing a Neural Network

I have the write up for the first project here: https://github.com/EricSchles/NYU_summer_2018/blob/master/Projects.md

There is also template code which shows you which functions to implement found here: https://github.com/EricSchles/NYU_summer_2018/blob/master/projects/template_project_one.py

Homework turn in policy:

I've decided we'll be using git to push code.  So you should have a private repo where you push all your code.  This can either be on github or gitlab or bitbucket.  Private repos are free on gitlab and bitbucket, so it's my preference that you use that.  If you want to pay for github, your welcome to.  I'll be making a video either today or tomorrow on how to create private repos in gitlab and bitbucket.  Once the assignment is due, you'll need to make the repo public and pass me the link.  I will be emailing back grades and feedback on a rolling basis, starting Friday night and finishing by sunday night.  

If something is completely wrong, I may ask you to redo the assignment or do another assignment, to make sure you get the concept.  Those assignments will come from hackerrank.

How the course will be run:

You should watch the lectures that I record.  During class I will give the lecture again at a faster pace. I will also walk through any questions from students to ensure there are no issues in understanding.  

After that, we will move onto doing homework.  Since all assignments are up you can work on whatever assignment you happen to be up to.  Assignments are due on thursdays.  But you can turn in assignments early.  I will grade things as they come in.  

It is important to note, the lectures will be more aligned with preparing you for the projects, whereas the text book will help you prepare for the exams and homework assignments.  

I've decided on a 33/33/33 split on homework, test and projects.  Attendance will be optional, but is expected.  Also, I'm going to allow for extra credit, so if you don't test well, but are good at project work, you can do extra projects to make up for poor test performance.  However, I won't allow for extra homework to make up for poor testing, this is because the homeworks are intended to be more or less straight forward, and so opportunity for learning is less.

Finally, I will be at microsoft every wednesday night in case anyone can't make lecture but still wants some help. I will also be holding emergency as needed office hours on sundays for one hour.  If you need additional help, please let me know and I will make time for you.

The Python meetup (which everyone should go to and I happen to be an organizer of) can be found here: https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/ 

The reason I signal you should go to the meetup - it's a great way to make sure you can continue to learn after the class is over, get help from seasoned developers and get a strong network.  Having a network of professionals will mean you will find a job easier, when you are looking.  And if you are new to development, it's usually easier to find work because NYC Python has a lot of corporate sponsors.
