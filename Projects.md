# Project One

## Deadline

The first project will be due June 21st

## Description 

In this project you will be building a tiny computer.  By understanding how your computer works, you'll better be able to understand how computation works more generally speaking.  For this project you'll be implementing the basics of a computer system.

Specifically, we will be making an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for this project.  You will need to implement a series of logic gates in order to build this ALU.  These gates will be written as functions.

## Steps

1. In order to get background on computer systems you'll need to watch this excellent [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=2).  For a diagram of the actual ALU you'll need to look at [this diagram found on wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit#/media/File:74181aluschematic.png)

2. Next you'll need to follow the blueprint, implementing the functions outlined in template_project_one.py - also found in the repo.   Make sure you change the name of the file from template_project_one.py to `project_one_[group_name].py` where group_name is filled in with the name of your group.

3. Turn in the project along with a write up of what you did.  You should explain each function and the choices you made when building your system.  You should also include three examples programs that use your ALU to perform some simple computation.
