    "While recursion, once you are used to it, appears more elegant than iteration, it is far more costly, especially in Python.  In some languages recursion is optimized.  But the typical case is for or while loops are much faster than recursion.  Also they are far more memory efficient, because you don't need to make anywhere near as many function calls.\n",
